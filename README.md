# Small Pure-JavaScript Projects

This is a collection of 20 small projects I coded to practice pure JavaScript concepts. No frameworks were used, just plain HTML, CSS, and javaScript.

## Projects

Here's a list of all the projects I coded for this challenge. You may see them all on [this website](https://spaceinvadev.github.io/JavaScript20/) I created to showcase them.

1. [Quote Generator](/projects/quote-generator). This is a small app to fetch random quotes from an API via an async/await function.

2. [Infinite Scroll](/projects/infinite-scroll/). For this project, I added "infinite scroll" to display images fetched from the Unsplash API.

3. [Picture-in-Picture](/projects/picture-in-picture/). An app to share any screen from your computer and play in picture-in-picture mode.

4. [Joke Teller](projects/joke-teller/). This app fetches a random joke from an API and pass it to the native WebSpeech API to have it played on the browser. It was a fun one to code!
