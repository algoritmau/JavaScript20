# Small Pure-JavaScript Projects

This is a collection of 20 small projects I coded to practice pure JavaScript concepts. No frameworks were used, just plain HTML, CSS, and javaScript.

## Projects

1. [Quote Generator]('./quote-generator'). This is a small app to fetch random quotes from an API via an async/await function.
